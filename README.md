#  Breast Cancer Prediction with PyTorch

A machine learning project that predicts whether a breast tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using a **Neural Network built in PyTorch**.  
This project leverages the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** from scikit-learn and demonstrates how deep learning can support **early cancer detection**.
