# Breast-Cancer-prediction
Breast Cancer Prediction using PyTorch: Built a feedforward neural network on the Wisconsin dataset to classify tumors as benign or malignant. Implemented preprocessing, a 1-hidden-layer (64 neurons, ReLU) model, trained with Adam &amp; BCE loss, and achieved strong accuracyâ€”showcasing deep learning in healthcare.
